This is my own simple Logistic Regression classifier, which I intend to run
on the EMNIST dataset.

Some features I want to support:
1) Regularization (L1, L2)
2) HyperParameter sweep (for learning rate, regularization parameter

For the parameter sweep, I wonder if I can build a utility that can be usable
for other models as well

The end goal for this project should be a class/utilities generic enough 
to work for any labelled dataset, which can be specified
